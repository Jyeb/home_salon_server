## Purpose
The purpose of this assessment piece was to find a commercial client and develop an application utilising the appropriate technology stack. Subsequent to the completion of the task, the final product is intended to see purposeful use, and assist the business of the client in question. 

Specifically, the chosen task was to perform a complete overhaul of an existing website for a client in the hair & beauty industry. The intent is to completely alter the UI/UX of the existing website in order to achieve a more modern aesthetic. On top of the improved experience for the clients customers, the website will also improve the experience for the business owner through the implementation of dynamic features.

Outside of the benefits for the client, the application will serve as a platform to further develop technical proficiency and showcase acquired skills to potential employers. 

## Functionality/Features 
The website which the business is currently using exists as a sequence of static web pages with minimal design features, and HTML text. In the creation of the new website, modern design principles will be applied with the use of a user friendly navigation bar, and made visually appealing through the use of CSS. 

One of the major changes from the existing product would see the addition of an admin link which would redirect to a login page in which only the business owner would be granted access. Once logged in the owner would have the ability to perform the CRUD operations on the existing packages being sold, which in this case is a service. 

## Target Audience  
The target audience of the application is those who are seeking the services of the client the business is to be created for. It is also targeted at the client/business owner themselves to provide a more pleasing experience in the use of their website. 
Potential employers in the tech space are also apart of the target audience as the website will act as a showcase of knowledge for the developers who created it. 

## Tech Stack 
In the creation of the application the MERN stack will be used, which consists of the following technologies: 

* MongoDB 
* Express.js
* React.js
* Node.js 

MongoDB is a NoSQL database language used in the development of web applications. It will be used to store the information of the packages which are being sold, allowing the client to update, and alter them at will. The MongoAtlas cloud tool will be used as the management system responsible for handling the intricacies of the database. In order to create the server and API the express.js framework is to be used, it is one of the most popular web application frameworks built on JavaScript. Both of these technologies will use the node runtime environment which is designed to execute native JavaScript code outside of a web browser, and also permits the use of a large variety of existing functionality native the node extension.
